# Roblox Offset Dumper & Reader

A comprehensive Roblox offset dumper and game data reader that integrates with a custom kernel driver for memory access. This project allows you to dump Roblox offsets dynamically and read game data such as player health, position, and more.

## Features

### üéØ Offset Dumping
- **Dynamic Pattern Scanning**: Automatically finds offsets using memory pattern scanning
- **Version Detection**: Detects Roblox version and adapts patterns accordingly
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Dumps offsets for health, position, camera, players, and more
- **Export Functionality**: Saves offsets to C++ header files for use in other projects

### üéÆ Game Data Reading
- **Player Information**: Read health, position, walk speed, user ID, and more
- **Instance Data**: Access workspace instances, their properties, and hierarchy
- **Camera Data**: Get camera position, rotation, field of view, and view matrix
- **Game Information**: Retrieve place ID, game ID, creator ID, and game state

### üõ†Ô∏è Interactive Features
- **Real-time Data**: Live reading of game data
- **Memory Modification**: Change player health, walk speed, and position
- **Teleportation**: Teleport players to specific coordinates
- **ESP-like Features**: Get instances in radius and visibility information

- `FakeDataModelPointer` - Pointer to the data model
- `DataModelOffset` - Offset to data model in memory

### Player Offsets
- `Health` - Player health value
- `MaxHealth` - Maximum health value
- `Position` - Player position (Vector3)
- `Velocity` - Player velocity (Vector3)
- `Walkspeed` - Player walk speed
- `JumpPower` - Player jump power
- `UserId` - Player user ID
- `Team` - Player team information

### Instance Offsets
- `Name` - Instance name
- `ClassName` - Instance class name
- `Parent` - Parent instance
- `ChildrenStart/End` - Children array
- `Transparency` - Instance transparency
- `CanCollide` - Collision flag
- `Anchored` - Anchored flag

### Camera Offsets
- `CameraPosition` - Camera position
- `CameraRotation` - Camera rotation
- `FieldOfView` - Field of view
- `ViewMatrix` - View matrix for rendering

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10
- Windows 10/11 (for kernel driver)
- Administrator privileges (for driver installation)

### Build Steps

1. **Build the Kernel Driver**:
   ```bash
   cd centipede-driver
   # Open in Visual Studio and build
   # Or use MSBuild from command line
   ```

2. **Build the User-Mode Application**:
   ```bash
   cd um
   # Open in Visual Studio and build
   # Or use MSBuild from command line
   ```

### Driver Installation

1. **Enable Test Mode** (if not already enabled):
   ```cmd
   bcdedit /set testsigning on
   ```

2. **Install the Driver**:
   ```cmd
   # Run as Administrator
   pnputil /add-driver centipede-driver.inf /install
   ```

3. **Load the Driver**:
   ```cmd
   # Run as Administrator
   sc create centipede type= kernel binPath= "C:\path\to\centipede-driver.sys"
   sc start centipede
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Start Roblox** and join a game
2. **Run the application** as Administrator:
   ```cmd
   um.exe
   ```

3. **The application will**:
   - Automatically find the Roblox process
   - Dump all relevant offsets
   - Save offsets to `roblox_offsets.h`
   - Display game information
   - Provide an interactive menu

### Interactive Menu Options

1. **Set Local Player Health** - Modify your health value
2. **Set Local Player Walk Speed** - Change your movement speed
3. **Teleport to Position** - Teleport to specific coordinates
4. **Refresh Player List** - Update the list of players
5. **Exit** - Close the application

```

## Advanced Usage

### Using the Dumped Offsets

The dumped offsets are saved in `roblox_offsets.h` and can be used in other projects:

```cpp
#include "roblox_offsets.h"

// Read player health
float health = read_memory<float>(player_address + Offsets::Health);

// Read player position
Vector3 position = read_memory<Vector3>(player_address + Offsets::Position);

// Set player walk speed
float new_speed = 50.0f;
write_memory<float>(player_address + Offsets::Walkspeed, new_speed);
```

### Custom Pattern Scanning

You can add custom patterns to find specific offsets:

```cpp
// Add to roblox_dumper.cpp
uintptr_t RobloxDumper::find_custom_offset() {
    std::string pattern = "\x48\x8B\x05\x00\x00\x00\x00\x48\x85\xC0";
    std::string mask = "xxx????xxx";
    
    uintptr_t result = find_pattern_in_module(pattern, mask, "RobloxPlayerBeta.exe");
    if (result != 0) {
        int32_t offset = read_memory<int32_t>(result + 3);
        return result + 7 + offset;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This tool is for educational and research purposes only.

- **Anti-Cheat Detection**: Roblox has anti-cheat systems that may detect memory modifications
- **Terms of Service**: Using this tool may violate Roblox's Terms of Service
- **Account Risk**: Using memory modification tools can result in account bans
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to create driver handle"**
   - Ensure the kernel driver is loaded
   - Run as Administrator
   - Check if driver service is running

2. **"Failed to find Roblox process"**
   - Make sure Roblox is running
   - Check if using correct process name
   - Try alternative process names

3. **"Failed to dump offsets"**
   - Roblox version may have changed
   - Update pattern signatures
   - Check if offsets are still valid

4. **"Access denied" errors**
   - Run as Administrator
   - Check Windows Defender settings
   - Verify driver permissions

### Debug Information

Enable debug output by modifying the driver:

```cpp
// In centipede-driver/src/main.cpp
void debug_print(PCSTR msg) {
    KdPrintEx((
        DPFLTR_IHVDRIVER_ID,
        DPFLTR_INFO_LEVEL,
        "Centipede: %s\n",
        msg
    ));
}
```
